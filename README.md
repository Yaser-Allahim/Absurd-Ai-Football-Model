# 👁️ Absurd AI – 3D Match Viewer for Football Games ⚽

Absurd AI's model is an AI-driven system designed to bring football games to life in full 3D. Inspired by the free-camera view in FIFA games, our project aims to allow fans, referees, analysts, and developers to experience football matches from any angle—just like in a video game.

> ❗ Note: This project is currently in the ideation and planning phase. No model or code has been fully implemented yet.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To build an AI system that:
- **Detects players and the ball** in live or recorded football matches.
- **Reconstructs the field and player movement** in a 3D environment.
- **Simulates a free-camera view**, allowing users to navigate the match from any angle.

### Potential Uses:
- Enhanced fan experience
- Referee training or multi-angle review
- Tactical analysis
- Broadcasting innovation

## 🧠 Powered by Edge Impulse

This project will utilize [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/) for data collection, training, and model deployment. Since Edge Impulse works with embedded machine learning and supports computer vision, it's a perfect starting point for building and testing our model.

## 📽️ Concept Demo

We’ve created a short video to showcase what the optimal sample video looks like. This video is a **Early demonstration** it does not yet feature THAT accurate detection or rendering.
